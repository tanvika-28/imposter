DIFFICULTY LEVEL: ${difficultyMod}

CULTURAL CONSIDERATION: ${langConfig.culturalNote}

WORD SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Words must be nouns (things, not actions or descriptions)
- Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, or technical jargon
- Ensure words are spell-able and pronounceable
- Mix different subcategories within the main category
- Include a variety of word lengths and complexities
- Ensure words are culturally relevant to the specified language
- Avoid overly obscure or niche terms

HINT CRAFTING RULES:
1. Each hint should be 1 word maximum
2. Hints should be indirect associations, not direct descriptors
3. Use broad categories, feelings, or abstract connections
4. Avoid physical descriptions (color, size, shape)
5. Avoid location-specific or functional hints
6. No synonyms, rhymes, or wordplay
7. Think of distant but logical connections

HINT STRATEGY:
- Use emotional or conceptual associations rather than literal descriptions
- Reference broader categories or themes
- Use contextual clues from completely different domains
- Aim for "aha!" moments rather than obvious connections
- Each hint should feel like a puzzle piece, not a direct clue
- Include playful, unexpected, or mildly humorous associations
- Think of pop culture references, internet culture, or amusing situations
- Use ironic or contrasting concepts that create surprise

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- Each word must have exactly 3 hints
- Hints must be helpful for guessing but not too obvious
- Test mentally: Could someone reasonably guess the word from these hints?
- Ensure variety in word length and complexity within the set
